Description: SynMut designs synonymous mutants for viral research. 
    The dinucleotide bias is significant in most RNA virus. There are increasing demands on
    designing the virus mutants with extreme dinucleotide or codon composition. This tool can take 
    both dinucleotide preference and/or codon usage bias into account while designing mutants.
    It also works well for desinging mutants with extremely over-/under- represented dinucleotides. 
    It is a powerful tool for in silico designs of viral mutants.
