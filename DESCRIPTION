Description: SynMut designs synonymous mutants for DNA sequences.  
    There are increasing demands on designing virus mutants with specific dinucleotide or codon composition. This tool can take both dinucleotide preference and/or codon usage bias into account while designing mutants. It also works well for desinging mutants with extremely over-/under- represented dinucleotides. It is a powerful tool for in silico designs of DNA sequence mutants.
